	abstract = {The Fluidigm Digital Array IFC is a nanofluidic biochip where digital PCR reactions can be performed with isolated individual DNA template molecules. This chip is part of a family of integrated fluidic circuits (IFC) and contains a network of fluid lines, NanoFlex™ valves and chambers. NanoFlex™ valves are made of an elastomeric material that deflects under pressure to create a tight seal and are used to regulate the flow of liquids in the IFC. Digital Arrays have enabled a different approach to digital PCR, by partitioning DNA molecules instead of diluting them. Single DNA molecules are randomly distributed into nanoliter volume reaction chambers and then PCR amplified in the presence of a fluorophore-containing probe. Positive fluorescent signal indicates the presence of a DNA molecule in a reaction chamber, while negative chambers are blank. IFC technology enables the delivery of very precise volumes of solutions in a simple, fast procedure, utilizing a minimum of sample and assay reagents. The development of the IFC technology and the Digital Array chip has revolutionized the field of biology, and has been utilized in gene copy number studies, absolute quantitation (molecule counting) of genomic DNA and cDNA, rare mutation detection, and digital haplotyping.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Both the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and quantitative isothermal amplification (qIA) are standard methods for nucleic acid quantification. Numerous real-time read-out technologies have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplification-based techniques, there are only few tools for pre-processing of amplification data. However, a transparent tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable in several scenarios, for example, during the development of new instruments.
RESULTS: chipPCR is an R: package for the pre-processing and quality analysis of raw data of amplification curves. The package takes advantage of R: 's S4 object model and offers an extensible environment. chipPCR contains tools for raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, imputation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to detect the start and end of an amplification curve. The capabilities of the software are enhanced by the implementation of algorithms unavailable in R: , such as a 5-point stencil for derivative interpolation. Simulation tools, statistical tests, plots for data quality management, amplification efficiency/quantification cycle calculation, and datasets from qPCR and qIA experiments are part of the package. Core functionalities are integrated in GUIs (web-based and standalone shiny applications), thus streamlining analysis and report generation.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chipPCR. Source code: https://github.com/michbur/chipPCR.

	abstract = {Real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) is a standard technique in most laboratories used for various applications in basic research. Analysis of qPCR data is a crucial part of the entire experiment, which has led to the development of a plethora of methods. The released tools either cover specific parts of the workflow or provide complete analysis solutions.

Here, we surveyed 27 open-access software packages and tools for the analysis of qPCR data. The survey includes 8 Microsoft Windows, 5 web-based, 9 R-based and 5 tools from other platforms. Reviewed packages and tools support the analysis of different qPCR applications, such as RNA quantification, DNA methylation, genotyping, identification of copy number variations, and digital PCR. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual software tools, such as data exchange formats, availability of a graphical user interface, included procedures for graphical data presentation, and offered statistical methods. In addition, we provide an overview about quantification strategies, and report various applications of qPCR.

Our comprehensive survey showed that most tools use their own file format and only a fraction of the currently existing tools support the standardized data exchange format RDML. To allow a more streamlined and comparable analysis of qPCR data, more vendors and tools need to adapt the standardized format to encourage the exchange of data between instrument software, analysis tools, and researchers.},
