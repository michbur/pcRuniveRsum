# Packages in pcRuniveRsum (in alphabetical order)

## [chipPCR](http://github.com/michbur/chipPCR)  

### [Changelog of the stable version](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chipPCR/ChangeLog)  


The chipPCR package is a toolkit of functions to preprocess amplification curve data. Amplification data can be obtained from conventional PCR reactions or isothermal amplification reactions. The package contains functions to normalize and baseline amplification curves, a routine to detect the start of an amplification reaction, several smoothers for amplification data, a function to distinguish positive and negative amplification reactions and a function to determine the amplification efficiency. The smoothers are based on LOWESS, moving average, cubic splines, Savitzky-Golay and others. 

In addition the first approximate approximate derivative maximum (FDM) and second approximate derivative maximum (SDM) can be calculated by a 5-point-stencil as quantification points from real-time amplification curves. chipPCR contains data sets of experimental nucleic acid amplification systems including the VideoScan HCU and a capillary convective PCR (ccPCR) system. The amplification data were generated by helicase dependent amplification (HDA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under various temperature conditions. As detection system intercalating dyes (EvaGreen, SYBR Green) and hydrolysis probes (TaqMan) were used.

## [mbMCA](http://github.com/michbur/MBmca)   

### [Changelog of the stable version](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MBmca/ChangeLog)  

The MBmca package provides data sets and lightweight utilities for nucleic acid melting curve analysis and presentation on microbead surfaces.  



## [RDML](http://github.com/kablag/RDML)  
  
### [Changelog of the stable version](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RDML/ChangeLog)  
  
Imports real-time thermo cycler (qPCR) data from Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) format files and transforms to the appropriate formats of the 'qpcR' and 'chipPCR' packages.
