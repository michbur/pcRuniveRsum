[R is a powerful statistical programming language.](https://cran.r-project.org/) 

It has advanced [graphics methods](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Graphics.html) and supports [reproducible research](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html) and [web technologies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html).

R's applications are far beyond classicial statistics - it is widely used among others in [finance](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html), [genetics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Genetics.html), [social sciences](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SocialSciences.html) and...

## PCR analysis

Every package in the pcRuniveRsum helps in investigating data from qPCR, dPCR, qIA and MCA experiments, starting from importing data into R environment to creating interactive study reports.
